# Predicting Loan Defaults with Logistic Regression
The purpose of this project is to predict which applicants are likely to default on their loans using Logistic Regression. The dataset includes 30 variables for 50,000 loans. This dataset will be cleaned and any missing values will be imputed before creating the predictive model. The model will help the banks to predict the outcome of the loan therby reducing the risk associated with loan defaults.
